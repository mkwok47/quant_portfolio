I have been used Python to create and backtest original trading strategies since 2019 and began deploying to production (for personal-use) in 2022.
I focus on combining creativity, intuition, open-mindedness, and the scientific method.
I embrace the spirit of exploration and see things for myself rather than take somebody else’s word for it.
I approach research from a practicality-first mindset because at the end of the day, performance in the real world is what matters.

What I look for in my algos:
1. Statistically significant number of backtested trades = luck is not in the equation
2. Based on an unambiguous set of rules = repeatable and automatable
3. Zero correlation with underlying and market = success is timeless and independent of everchanging fundamentals, news, and events
4. Returns that significantly beat buy-hold underlying and market = the results are worth the extra costs and effort of trading
5. Minimal parameters = minimal risk of overfitting
6. Minimal drawdown = maximum happiness

There’s no saying whether something will work until it works in practice, for example against obstacles like illiquidity and slippage.
Even if something is working, it may just be a matter of time until it stops working. 
There are often more ways for things to go wrong than right, so continual monitoring and innovation is key.

Samples of code I wrote and use for personal algorithmic trading activities. APIs I work with include Alpaca and TDA.
1. minute_functions.py: functions that assist with researching and backtesting at the minutely-level
2. alpaca_table2.py: create and maintain stock price datasets (primarily at the minutely-level) in local SQL database via sqlite3
3. selling_option_prem.ipynb: analyze probabilities of ITM/OTM option expiration and associated premiums

# Portfolio
Samples of code I wrote and use for personal algorithmic trading activities. APIs I work with include Alpaca and TDA. I intentionally leave out useful findings for 
1. minute_functions.py: functions that assist with researching and backtesting at the minutely-level
2. alpaca_table2.py: create and maintain stock price datasets (primarily at the minutely-level) in local SQL database via sqlite3
3. selling_option_prem.ipynb: analyze probabilities of ITM/OTM option expiration and associated premiums
4. top_gainers_effect.ipynb: analyze the following interday gap (if any) and intraday change, and any relationships between them, following a day of high gain for top gainers

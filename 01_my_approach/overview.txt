I use Python to develop and deploy original trading strategies.
I combine intuitive, creative thinking with the scientific method.
I embrace the pioneer spirit and see things for myself.
I approach research with a practicality-first mindset.

What I look for in my algos:
1. Statistically significant number of backtested trades = luck is not in the equation
2. Based on an unambiguous set of rules = repeatable and automatable
3. Zero correlation w/ underlying and market = success is timeless and independent of everchanging fundamentals
4. Returns that significantly beat buy-hold underlying and market = results are worth the extra effort of trading
5. Minimal parameters = minimal risk of overfitting
6. Minimal drawdown = maximum happiness

Thereâ€™s no saying whether something will work until it works in practice.
Examples of obstacles are illiquidity and slippage.
Even if something is working, it may just be a matter of time until it stops working. 
There are often more ways for things to go wrong than right, so continual monitoring and innovation is vital.

THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE: 
What is true, to what extent, why, and how do you know?

COGNITIVE BIASES: 
For survival, humans tend to believe they know things (overconfidence bias), and they’re inclined to keep confirming they’re right rather than try to prove themselves wrong (confirmation bias). Potential reasons are they want to be right (optimism bias), they don’t want to be wrong (ego), and/or there are just not enough resources (time, energy) or necessity to acquire more knowledge and challenge one’s beliefs. The more you know, the more you realize you don’t know. 
In the noble search for truth, it is important to avoid these biases.

INFINITE POSSIBILITIES: 
There are so many markets, securities, and methods of trading that possibilities are endless. Things also evolve over time, so current understandings 
may no longer hold true in the future. This is a reason to choose open-mindedness whenever possible.

HYPOTHESIS ACCEPTANCE VS REJECTION: 
Just because a hypothesis is not rejected does not mean it is accepted. There exists the gray area where you don’t have enough evidence to reject or 
accept whether something is true. One must be careful before making definitive conclusions when exploring the unknown.

CORRELATIOIN VS CAUSATION: 
It’s common to see praise for someone who received a desirable outcome (“predicted” a market event or reaped stellar returns). However, a positive result 
does not automatically mean the person’s reasoning was significant or “correct” (which can be hard to assess to begin with). There is room for chance and 
coincidence especially in lower-frequency and shorter-term occurrences, and especially when the final outcome can be shaped by a plethora of factors – 
both known and unknown, foreseen and unforseen, random and nonrandom.

STEALTH IS OF ESSENCE:
Markets operate by the fundamental laws of supply/demand. If there exists an edge (inefficiency), it's generally in one's best favor not to share it with 
others because once others exploit it too, the edge could diminish until it is gone.

TIME IS OF ESSENCE: 
By the time you can truly know something, it may already be too late to make use of this information. There is a balance between seeking truth and 
obtaining real-world results.
